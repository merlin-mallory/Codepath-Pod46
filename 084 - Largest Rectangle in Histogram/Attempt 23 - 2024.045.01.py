        084 - Largest Rectangle in Histogram

        https://leetcode.com/problems/largest-rectangle-in-histogram/

        Given an array of integers heights representing the histogram's bar height
        where the width of each bar is 1,
        return the area of the largest rectangle in the histogram.

        Example 1:
        Input: heights = [2,1,5,6,2,3]
        Output: 10
        Explanation: The above is a histogram where width of each bar is 1.
        The largest rectangle is shown in the red area, which has an area = 10 units.

        Example 2:
        Input: heights = [2,4]
        Output: 4

        Constraints:
        1 <= heights.length <= 10^5
        0 <= heights[i] <= 10^4

        Plan:
        Sliding Window with Stack
        Time: O(n)
        Space: O(n)
        Edge: None
        '''
        stack = []  # [i, heights[i]]
        max_area = 0
        for i, cur in enumerate(heights):
            start = i
            while stack and (cur < stack[-1][1]):
                stack_i, stack_v = stack.pop()
                cur_area = stack_v * (i - stack_i)
                max_area = max(max_area, cur_area)
                start = stack_i
            stack.append([start, heights[i]])
        for stack_i, stack_v in stack:
            max_area = max(max_area, stack_v * (len(heights) - stack_i))
        return max_area

print(result.largestRectangleArea([2,1,5,6,2,3]))   # 10
print(result.largestRectangleArea([2,4]))           # 4
