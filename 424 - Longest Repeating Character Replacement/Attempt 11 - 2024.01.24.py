        You are given a string s and an integer k.
        You can choose any character of the string and change it to any other uppercase English character.
        You can perform this operation at most k times.

        Return the length of the longest substring containing the same letter you can get after performing the above
        operations.

        Input: s = "ABAB", k = 2
        Output: 4
        Explanation: Replace the two 'A's with two 'B's or vice versa.

        Input: s = "AABABBA", k = 1
        Output: 4
        Explanation: Replace the one 'A' in the middle with 'B' and form "AABBBBA".
        The substring "BBBB" has the longest repeating letters, which is 4.

        Constraints:

        1 <= s.length <= 105
        s consists of only uppercase English letters.
        0 <= k <= s.length

        Plan:
        Sliding Window
        1. Create window_dict. Keys: Chars in window, Values: Count of keys.
        2. Loop while l 
        '''

result = Solution()
print(result.characterReplacement("ABAB", 2))       # 4
print(result.characterReplacement("AABABBA", 1))    # 4
