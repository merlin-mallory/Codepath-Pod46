        Given an integer array nums, return an array answer such that answer[i] is equal to the product of all the
        elements of nums except nums[i].

        The product of any prefix or suffix of nums is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit integer.

        You must write an algorithm that runs in O(n) time and without using the division operation.

        Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]
        Output: [24,12,8,6]

        Input: nums = [-1,1,0,-3,3]
        Output: [0,0,9,0,0]

        Constraints:
        2 <= nums.length <= 10^5
        -30 <= nums[i] <= 30
        The product of any prefix or suffix of nums is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit integer.

        Follow up: Can you solve the problem in O(1) extra space complexity? (The output array does not count as
        extra space for space complexity analysis.)

        Plan:
        Array with Prefix/Postfix
        Time: O(n)
        Space: O(1)
        '''
        final_arr = [1] * len(nums)
        prefix = 1
        for i in range(1, len(nums)):
            prefix *= nums[i-1]
            final_arr[i] = prefix
        prefix = 1
        for i in range(len(nums)-2, -1, -1):
            prefix *= nums[i+1]
            final_arr[i] *= prefix
        return final_arr
