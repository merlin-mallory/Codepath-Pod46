        Given an array of strings strs, group the anagrams together. You can return the answer in any order.

        An Anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically
        using all the original letters exactly once.

        Input: strs = ["eat","tea","tan","ate","nat","bat"]
        Output: [["bat"],["nat","tan"],["ate","eat","tea"]]

        Input: strs = [""]
        Output: [[""]]

        Input: strs = ["a"]
        Output: [["a"]]

        Constraints:

        1 <= strs.length <= 10^4
        0 <= strs[i].length <= 100
        strs[i] consists of lowercase English letters.

            anagram_dict[tuple(sorted(str))].append(str)
        return anagram_dict.values()
