        Given an array of strings strs, group the anagrams together. You can return the answer in any order.

        An Anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically
        using all the original letters exactly once.

        Input: strs = ["eat","tea","tan","ate","nat","bat"]
        Output: [["bat"],["nat","tan"],["ate","eat","tea"]]

        Input: strs = [""]
        Output: [[""]]

        Input: strs = ["a"]
        Output: [["a"]]

        Constraints:

        1 <= strs.length <= 10^4
        0 <= strs[i].length <= 100
        strs[i] consists of lowercase English letters.

        Plan:
        Hashmap
        Time: O(w * (n log n)), where n = max len of strs[i], and w = len(strs)
        Space: O(1)
        Edge: None
        '''
        import collections
        dict = collections.defaultdict(list)
        for cur_str in strs:
            dict[tuple(sorted(cur_str))].append(cur_str)
        return dict.values()
