    def dailyTemperatures(self, temperatures: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        '''
        Given an array of integers temperatures represents the daily temperatures, return an array answer such that
        answer[i] is the number of days you have to wait after the ith day to get a warmer temperature. If there is
        no future day for which this is possible, keep answer[i] == 0 instead.

        Example 1:
        Input: temperatures = [73,74,75,71,69,72,76,73]
        Output: [1,1,4,2,1,1,0,0]

        Example 2:
        Input: temperatures = [30,40,50,60]
        Output: [1,1,1,0]

        Example 3:
        Input: temperatures = [30,60,90]
        Output: [1,1,0]

        Constraints:
        1 <= temperatures.length <= 10^5
        30 <= temperatures[i] <= 100

        Stack

        Space: O(n)

                stack_val, stack_i = stack.pop()
                answer[stack_i] = i - stack_i
            stack.append((cur, i))
        return answer
