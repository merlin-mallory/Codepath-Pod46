        A phrase is a palindrome if, after converting all uppercase letters into lowercase letters and removing all
        non-alphanumeric characters, it reads the same forward and backward. Alphanumeric characters include letters
        and numbers.

        Given a string s, return true if it is a palindrome, or false otherwise.

        Input: s = "A man, a plan, a canal: Panama"
        Output: true
        Explanation: "amanaplanacanalpanama" is a palindrome.

        Input: s = "race a car"
        Output: false
        Explanation: "raceacar" is not a palindrome.

        Input: s = " "
        Output: true
        Explanation: s is an empty string "" after removing non-alphanumeric characters.
        Since an empty string reads the same forward and backward, it is a palindrome.

        Constraints:

        1 <= s.length <= 2 * 10^5
        s consists only of printable ASCII characters.

        Plan:
        1. Sanitize the input to remove all non-alphanumeric characters and lowercase all the alpha characters.
        2. Check the sanitized string for palindrome status.
        '''
        sanitized_s = []
        for i in range(len(s)):
            if s[i].isalnum():
                sanitized_s.append(s[i].lower())
        return sanitized_s == sanitized_s[::-1]
