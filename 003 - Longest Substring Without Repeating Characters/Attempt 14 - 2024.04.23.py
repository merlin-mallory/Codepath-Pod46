        Given a string s, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.

        Input: s = "abcabcbb"
        Output: 3
        Explanation: The answer is "abc", with the length of 3.

        Input: s = "bbbbb"
        Output: 1
        Explanation: The answer is "b", with the length of 1.

        Input: s = "pwwkew"
        Output: 3
        Explanation: The answer is "wke", with the length of 3.
        Notice that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring.

        Constraints:
        0 <= s.length <= 5 * 10^4
        s consists of English letters, digits, symbols and spaces.

        Plan:
        Sliding Window
        Time: O(n)
        Space: O(n)
        Edge: Len of s can be 0
