        https://leetcode.com/problems/letter-combinations-of-a-phone-number/

        Given a string containing digits from 2-9 inclusive, return all possible letter combinations that the number
        could represent. Return the answer in any order.

        A mapping of digits to letters (just like on the telephone buttons) is given below. Note that 1 does not map
        to any letters.

        Constraints:
        0 <= digits.length <= 4
        digits[i] is a digit in the range ['2', '9'].
